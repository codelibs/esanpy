# Esanpy: Elasticsearch based Analyzer for Python

Esanpy is Python text analyzer based on Elasticsearch.
Using embedded Elasticsearch, Esanpy provides powerful and fully-customizable text analysis.
Since Esanpy manages Elasticsearch instance internally, you do not need to install/configure Elasticsearch.
